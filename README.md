#SudokuSage

DESCRIPTION:

Sudoku Sage is an interactive web-based Sudoku platform developed by Blue Sage Games. It allows players to create, manage, and play Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels, complete with authentication and personalized game data storage. Built using React on the frontend and Node.js/Express with MongoDB on the backend, the app provides a seamless and secure experience across sessions.

Users can register, log in, and save games, with each game storing difficulty, hints used, and mistakes made. The authentication system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for access control and refresh tokens for secure session management. Players can create new games, view their existing ones in a dynamic table, and continue unfinished puzzles.

The interface features a clean design with conditional rendering for forms, a puzzle grid with editable cells, and intuitive navigation through menus for Settings, Controls, and Instructions. Developers can easily extend the system with additional puzzle modes or API integrations.

This project demonstrates full-stack development skills, including secure authentication, CRUD operations, React routing, and RESTful API integration, all structured to maintain scalability and data integrity.

Technologies Used:

Frontend: React, Axios, CSS Modules

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, JWT Authentication

Other: dotenv for environment management, bcrypt for password hashing

Sudoku Sage blends logic, design, and secure web architecture to deliver an engaging puzzle experience that bridges gameplay and modern web development practices.
